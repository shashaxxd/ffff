SSleuth

SSleuth is a firefox addon that ranks an established SSL connection to estimate the connection strength. It also gives a brief summary of the important SSL connection parameters.

This addon was primarily developed with the intent to rate the ciphers used in an SSL connection. The project maintains a list of cipher suites that are shipped with Firefox and a rank for each of them. The rankings are mainly inspired from Qualys's SSL labs server testing tool. The SSL labs testing is meant for web servers, more sophisticated and is much more than a cipher ranking service. However to know which ciphers are used when a user connects to a website, browser support and/or an addon is necessary. Firefox started exposing the full cipher suite name from version 25.0. Users can see the cipher suite by going to the URL notification lock icon -> More information or Page Info -> Security -> Technical details. The user can see the cipher suite used for connection and firefox's assessment of the strength of the cipher.

This addon attempts to enhance this visibility of ciphers to the user, by ranking it and appropriateley color coding it. The addon panel also gives information on perfect forward secrecy, firefox connection status and the certificate details.
Ranking Rationale

The ranking mechanism is in the early stages now, and might change in future. User feedback and inputs on the ranking are welcome!

The overall connection rankings depend on these parameters

    Cipher suite rank
    Perfect forward secrecy
    Firefox Connection status
    A valid certificate (matching domain/ valid dates)
    And an extended validation certificate.

Cipher suite ranking

Cipher suite rankings are based on the encryption algorithm used and the HMAC. Stronger block ciphers (like AES-256, CAMELLIA-256) are ranked the highest (10/10) while ciphers using smaller keylength (eg: DES) are demoted. Although RC4 ciphers are broken, at the moment for an attack to be practical, access to huge amounts of data encrypted using different keys are necessary. For this reason, although RC4 is ranked low, it is not the least.

SHA-1 and MD5 digests are reportedly weak, hence there are warning texts on the addon panel to notify of the weakness.

The cipher suite ranks can be found here : chrome/content/cipherSuites.js While calculating the overall connection rank, SSleuth gives a weight of 5/10 for cipher suite alone.
Perfect forward secrecy

If the cipher suite supports perfect forward secrecy (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellmann key exchange) a point of 1 is awarded. Since the points are given separately for PFS, the key exchange algorithm is not considered while ranking the cipher suites.
Firefox connection status

Another point is awarded for a 'Secure' connection status from Firefox's own flags. The Firefox flag reports 3 states : 'Secure', 'Broken' or 'Insecure'. For the latter 2 states, the API does not really inform of the reason as to why. Many a times, the 'Broken' state is due to http content loaded over a secure connection. The same state can also be reported for potentially insecure content (flash plugins). Firefox notifies the user on these explicity via the browser UI. If the states are 'Broken' or 'Insecure' there are no points awarded.
Valid certificate

A valid certificate earns another point. As of now, the validity is checked for a matching domain name and valid dates on the certificate. An extended validation (EV) certificate also gains another point out of 10.

This is how the overall connection ranking is calculated :

Cipher rank(5) + PFS(2) + Extended Validation(1) + Firefox connection status(1) + Valid certificate(1) = Connection Rank(10)

No claims are made that the above approach is the right way to estimate connection strength. If possible, a future release of the addon will make the ranking mechanism configurable, so advanced users can tweak the way the strength is estimated.
References

The cipher strength rankings and those reported by SSL labs were compared during the development. Firefox developer Brian Smith makes a proposal here on the cipher suites to be enabled/disabled for all major browsers, along with a catalogue of common cipher suites.

There is also an IETF working group that aims to propose a set of best practices for TLS clients and servers, including recommending versions of TLS, cipher suites etc. https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4
How to disable weak ciphers in Firefox

This addon only reports the states and do not attempt to make any changes in the user security preferences. If the user wishes to enable only strong ciphers, visit firefox configuration (about:config) and play around with the flags security.ssl3.<cipher-suite-name> The flags are boolean and can be enabled/disabled quickly. Please note that you must take extreme care while choosing to disable cipher suites. You may end up unable to connect to some web servers if you disable a lot of them!
UI

There is a URL bar notification box (next to Firefox's own notification area). A 'sleuth' cap and the rank notifies the user of the estimated strength. There is an optional toolbar button mode (choose from preferences), if the user wishes to move around a toolbar button.
Color coding

The color of the notification area changes from green (very good), to blue (good), orange (medium) and red(bad).
Keyboard shortcut

The panel can be easily brought up with the key combinations 'Ctrl' + 'Shift' + '}'. If the keyboard shortcut interferes with any existing addon and/or your keyboard doesn't support the key combination, please report it. It is however possible to change the keyboard shortcut via configuration.

    Navigate to 'about:config'
    Key in extensions.ssleuth to find all ssleuth configurables, and look for extensions.ssleuth.ui.keyshortcut
    The preference type is a string and you can change the modifieres and key. Please follow mozilla guidelines for modifiers and keys to set the shortcut. SSleuth uses 'keys' rather than 'keycodes'.
